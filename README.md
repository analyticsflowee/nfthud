## Resources and Credit

A simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) implementation of a Chrome Extension Template for a foldable side panel. Using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for development. Optimized to fit most of the modern webpage and save setting to chrome storage.
